<h2>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h2>
<H3>Name:</H3>Jasson Didhi Kumala
<h3>Login:</h3>JC425676
<h3>Goals</h3>
The goal is to create a website which provides a service for making a custom cosplay and fancy dresses and for also running a monthly cosplay party. This website is made so the business would improve and attract more cosplayers to be a part of the CossiePlay community also it would throw parties often
<h3>Success Evaluation</h3>
The site will attract all the cosplayers and will make a big community from it by gathering the cosplay party each month.   
<h3>Target Audience</h3>
We get cosplayers of all ages, but mostly they are 35 â€“ 50. We want the site to appeal to a younger audience than this, getting high school kids and young adults cosplaying.
